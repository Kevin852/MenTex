### Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Depression

CBT is based on two specific tasks: cognitive restructuring, in which the therapist and patient work together to change thinking patterns, and behavioral activation -- in which patients learn to overcome obstacles to participating in enjoyable activities.

## Digital Solution to the Problem

The objective of this project is to tackle depression in women by helping in diagnosis of depression and Cognitive Behavioral therapy for treating depression. The platform will be a Web application.
### Features of the Web application
#### Diagnosing Depression

A 3 minute Depression screening test which will give the level of depression. Results will be private.
#### Cognitive Behavioral therapy

* Cognitive restructuring : The website will provide a patient a 14-16 week therapy, which follows CBT. It finds a mental health professional/therapist near the patient who can be assigned to the patient for the next 14-16 weeks. The patient and therapist hold sessions together where they can discuss problems and work on negative thoughts of the patient. This is done via phone-calls or in-person.

* Behavioral activation : In Behavioral activation, Part of the process is looking at obstacles to taking part in that experience and deciding how to get past those obstacles by breaking the process down into smaller steps. This is achieved by a feature called Draw my life. In each week of the session, the patient will be assigned to draw something on the sketchpad (based on JavaScript) on the website. The difficulty will increase each week, making the process engaging and fun.
